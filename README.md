Welcome to Group 3's Attendance Project for TPEO!

Our project is designed to facilitate the attendance system in TPEO by creating 2 main pages:
- One for the executive team to create new meetings and visuals allowing them to track attendance trends
- A page for the general members to check-in to meetings, submit excused absence forms, and view their attendance   status

Our project is built with React for the frontend, and the Notion API for the backend
